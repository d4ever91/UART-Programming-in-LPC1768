Code Description:

Separate functions are used for UART initialization, UART interrupt handling, and APIs for UART access.

The function used for the UART initialization is

UARTInit(0, 57600); /* baud rate setting */

Here 0 defines the UART0 and 57600 is the baud rate.

To send a data by UART this function is used.

UARTSend( 0, (uint8_t *)UART0Buffer, UART0Count );

Here 0 tells it is UART0 and the data to be send is the same which is received.
