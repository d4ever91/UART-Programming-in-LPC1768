This is the Article to introduce the UART (Universal Asynchronous receiver/Transmitter) programming of ARM Cortex-M3 LPC1768 Microcontroller.
Here we are going to receive serial data from PC and echo back the same data while displaying the same on the LCD. 
Setting up the Environment for the development ofARM cortex M3 is well discussed in this article.

The LPC 1768 is ARM Cortex- M3 based Microcontrollers for embedded application features in low power consumption and a high level of integration.
The ARM Cortex M3 is designed in a such way to enhance debug features and a higher level of system integration.
It clocks at a CPU frequency of 100 MHz, and incorporates a 3-stage pipeline and uses a Harvard architecture with separate local instruction and data buses for third bus peripherals.
The ARM Cortex- M3 CPU have an internal pre-fetch unit to support speculative branching. The peripheral components include 512KB of flash memory, 64kb of data memory, Ethernet MAC, 
USB OTG, 4 UARTâ€™s, 8-channel general purpose DMA controller, 2 SSP Controllers, 10-bit DAC, Quadrature encoder interface, SPI interface, 3 I2C bus interface, 2 input plus 2 outputs I2S bus interface, 
4 general purpose timers, ultra-low power Real-Time Clock (RTC) with separate battery supply, and up to 70 general purpose I/O pins, 6-output general purpose PWM.
The LPC1768/66/65/64 are pin-compatible with the 100-pin LPC236x ARM7-based Microcontroller series.
